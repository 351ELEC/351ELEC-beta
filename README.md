# 351ELEC-beta
This repository exists to hold the [351ELEC](https://github.com/351ELEC/351ELEC) [beta releases](https://github.com/351ELEC/351ELEC-beta/releases) and other information around 351ELEC beta releases.  It was split off as a secondary repository to avoid confusion with the primary 351ELEC GitHub repo.

Beta releases are intended for **testing** and for users to **explore new functionality**.  They contain the latest committed code in `main` and will be unstable. Beta releases are **not** intended as a 'daily driver'!

# Information on Beta Releases
More information on using beta releases can be found on the 351ELEC [wiki](https://351elec.github.io/351ELEC-pages/Contributing-to-351ELEC#beta-builds).

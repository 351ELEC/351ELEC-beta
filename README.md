# 351ELEC-pre-release
This repository exists to hold the [351ELEC](https://github.com/351ELEC/351ELEC) [pre-releases](https://github.com/351ELEC/351ELEC-pre-release/releases) and other information around 351ELEC pre-releases.  It was split off as a secondary repository to avoid confusion with the primary 351ELEC GitHub repo.

Pre-releases are intended for users to **explore new functionality** prior to the next release image. They contain the latest committed code in `main` and are considered as "stable".
